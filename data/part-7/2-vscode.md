To work more effectively with GitHub, it’s essential to integrate it with an IDE like **VS Code**. There are two ways to do this:

---

## Method 1:  Local Setup
This method involves installing Git on your local machine and using the **GitHub Pull Request and Issues extension** in VS Code.

### **Steps to Set Up Git with VS Code:**
1. **Install Git** (Version Control System)  (if not installed)
   - Download and install Git from [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   - After installation, verify the installation by running:
     ```sh
     git --version
     ```

2. **Configure Git**

After installing Git, you need to configure Git by providing your full name and email address.You can start GitHub Desktop and configure using the graphical user interface as shown in the diagram below or use the command line.

![Configure Git](configure2.png "Please use your Full Name and email ")

***Configure Git with command line***

1. Open Git Bash.
2. Set your username and email, which will be associated with your commits. Use these commands, replacing "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your actual information:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```
***Check your Git Configuration***

```bash
git config --list
```

3. **Install VS Code** (if not installed)
   - Download it from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

4. **Install GitHub Pull Request and Issues Extension**
   - Open VS Code and go to the **Extensions Marketplace** (`Ctrl + Shift + X` / `Cmd + Shift + X` on macOS).
   - Search for **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** and install it.
   - Alternatively, install it directly from [VS Code Extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github).

5. **Authenticate GitHub in VS Code**
   - Open VS Code and navigate to:
     ```
     View > Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P / Cmd + Shift + P on macOS)
     ```
   - Search for **"GitHub: Sign in to GitHub"** and follow the prompts.

6. **Clone a GitHub Repository into VS Code**
   - Open VS Code and open the **Command Palette**.
   - Select **"Git: Clone"** and enter the repository URL from GitHub.  (Example Repo Link: https://github.com/Laurea-amk-Leppavaara/github-starter-space)
   - Choose a local folder to save the repository and start coding.

## Method 2: Using GitHub Codespaces (Cloud-Based IDE)
**GitHub Codespaces** is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to code directly in your browser without installing anything locally.

### **Benefits of GitHub Codespaces:**
- No installation required
- Access your code from any device
- Standardized development environment

### **How to Use GitHub Codespaces:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Click the **"Code"** button and select the **"Codespaces"** tab.
3. Click **"New codespace"** to launch a fully configured VS Code environment in your browser.

**Watch this short video on how to use GitHub Codespaces:**

###  **Which Method Should You Use?**
- **Use the local method** if you prefer working locally and need **full control over your development environment**.
- **Use GitHub Codespaces** if you want to **code from anywhere** without worrying about installations.
